NOTE:
Box2D has a collision callback system which I can use to do things in entities upon collisions. I attatch a copy of this pointer to the bodyDef.userData 
I may scrap this entity system and use c++ typeID that I have recently learned about. It seems promising. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typeid

TotalEntites: 5

Update that in Entity.hpp
