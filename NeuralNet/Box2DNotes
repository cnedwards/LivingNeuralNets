Objects are positioned by their origins.
Set objects according to their origins.

Cartesian coordinates are used, so flip SFML setPositions.

Meters are used so you have to /30 to convert to pixels from meters and when the library returns a value
in meters *30 for pixels.

Box2d world.queryAABB cannot be slanted, and entity vision is done by keeping the center of the vision 
box on the line a certain distance from the entity.

The world is expressed as a cartesian and flipped for rendering with SFML. The world is expressed in 
pixels and then converted for box2d. Calculations involving the two should use those.

AABB for queryWorld must be lowerBound in bottom left and upperBound in bottom right.
